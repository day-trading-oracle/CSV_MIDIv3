Rules for Expanding Bass Guitar Patterns
1. Maintain Music Theory Integrity
Diatonic Foundation: Base patterns on the major or minor scale degrees (R, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) unless the genre calls for chromaticism (e.g., Jazz, Blues).
Chord Compatibility: Ensure patterns align with common chord progressions in the genre (e.g., R-5-b7 fits a dominant 7th chord in Blues).
Resolution: Patterns should feel resolved or intentionally tense, depending on the mood (e.g., ending on R or 5 for stability, b7 or 6 for tension).
2. Genre-Specific Constraints
Rhythmic Identity: Stick to genre-typical rhythms (e.g., offbeat in Reggae, shuffle in Blues, straight eighths in Punk).
Techniques: Use genre-appropriate articulation (e.g., slap/pop in Funk, palm-muting in Metal, walking lines in Jazz).
Note Choices: Reflect harmonic tendencies (e.g., b3 and b7 in Blues/Metal, 6 and 9 in Jazz/Funk).
3. Systematic Variation
Use these methods to generate new patterns from each base pattern:

a. Key Transposition
Rule: Apply the pattern to all 12 chromatic keys (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B).
Example: R-5-R-5 in E becomes R-5-R-5 in F, G, etc. (12 variations per pattern).
b. Rhythmic Alteration
Rule: Change note durations or syncopation while preserving the genre’s feel.
Options: Quarters, eighths, sixteenths, triplets, dotted notes, rests.
Example: R-5-R-5 (eighths) → R-5-R-5 (triplets) or R-5-R-5 (dotted quarters).
c. Scale Degree Modification
Rule: Add, remove, or swap scale degrees (diatonic or chromatic) within the genre’s harmonic language.
Options: Add 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, b3, b7, #5, etc., based on mood/genre.
Example: R-5-R-5 → R-5-3-5 or R-5-b7-5.
d. Mood Adjustment
Rule: Shift the emotional tone by altering tempo, dynamics, or note choice.
Options: Driving → Soft (slower, legato), Dark → Bright (major notes like 3 or 6).
Example: R-5-R-5 (Driving) → R-5-8-3 (Soft, slower).
e. Technique Variation
Rule: Apply different playing styles suitable to the genre.
Options: Fingerstyle, pick, slap, pop, mute, slide, hammer-on, pull-off.
Example: R-5-b7-5 (fingerstyle) → R-5-b7-5 (slap).
f. Time Signature Shift
Rule: Adapt to alternate meters (e.g., 3/4, 5/4, 7/8) for complex genres like Prog Rock or Fusion.
Example: R-5-3-5 (4/4) → R-5-3-5-3 (5/4).
4. Avoid Redundancy
Uniqueness: Each new pattern must differ meaningfully (e.g., not just R-5-R-5 vs. R-5-5-R).
Check Overlap: Ensure variations don’t repeat across genres unless intentional (e.g., R-5-R-5 fits both Rock and Metal but should differ in articulation).
5. Practical Playability
Range: Keep patterns within a bass’s practical range (E1 to G4 on a 4-string).
Complexity: Balance simplicity and intricacy based on genre (e.g., Pop = simple, Jazz = intricate).
Feel: Patterns should groove naturally when repeated.
6. Documentation
Format Consistency: Stick to "Genre | Mood | Key | Pattern" for each entry.
Clarity: Specify rhythm (e.g., eighths, quarters) and techniques (e.g., slap, mute) where critical.
Example Expansion from One Pattern
Base: Rock | Driving | E | R-5-R-5, eighth notes

Key: R-5-R-5 in F (Rock | Driving | F | R-5-R-5, eighths).
Rhythm: R-5-R-5, triplets (Rock | Driving | E | R-5-R-5, triplets).
Scale Degree: R-5-3-5 (Rock | Gritty | E | R-5-3-5, eighths).
Mood: R-5-8-3, slow quarters (Rock | Soft | E | R-5-8-3, quarters).
Technique: R-5-R-5, slap (Rock | Funky | E | R-5-R-5, eighths, slap).
Time: R-5-R-5-3, 5/4 (Rock | Prog | E | R-5-R-5-3, eighths).
From one pattern, you get 6+ variations. Multiply across keys (12) and techniques (e.g., 5), and you’re at 360 from one base!

Applying to Your 100 Patterns
Start with the 100 patterns I provided.
For each:
Use 3-5 keys (e.g., E, A, D, G, C) → 500 patterns.
Add 2-3 rhythms (e.g., eighths, quarters, triplets) → 1,500 patterns.
Tweak with 1-2 mood or technique shifts → 3,000+ possibilities.
Trim duplicates and refine to hit 1,000 unique, high-quality patterns.
Let me know if you want me to expand a specific subset (e.g., 50 more Funk patterns) or refine this further!
