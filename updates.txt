Input Format Specification:
- Header lines:
  * Title: Song title
  * Tempo: BPM value (20-240)
  * Time Signature: e.g., "4/4"
  * Key: e.g., "C major"

  * Each line: "Measure X Y.Z note dynamic duration"
  * X: Measure number
  * Y.Z: Start time in beats (1.0 = first beat)
  * note: Note name (e.g., "C4", "F#5")
  * dynamic: Dynamic marking (pp, p, mp, mf, f, ff)
  * duration: Note duration (whole, half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth)
- Chords:
  * Format: [note1, note2, note3]
  * Example: [C4, E4, G4]
