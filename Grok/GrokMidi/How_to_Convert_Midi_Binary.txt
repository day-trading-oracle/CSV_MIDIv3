To convert the binary text (hexadecimal representation) of your MIDI track—like the Low Freq Track 30-150 Hz—into an actual .mid file, you need to transform the hex string into raw binary data and save it with the .mid extension. The text we’ve been working with (e.g., 4D 54 72 6B 00 00 18 48 ...) is a human-readable hex dump of a Standard MIDI File (SMF), and each pair of characters (e.g., 4D) represents one byte. I’ll explain how to do this and provide a template you can use to convert any of our MIDI tracks into a playable file, including a full song with multiple tracks.

How to Convert Binary Text to a MIDI File
Steps
Prepare the Hex String:
Take the full hex text (e.g., 4D 54 68 64 ... for a full file, or 4D 54 72 6B ... for a single track).
Remove spaces and line breaks to create a continuous string (e.g., 4D54726B00001848...).
Convert Hex to Binary:
Each pair of hex digits (e.g., 4D) equals one byte (e.g., 4D = 77 in decimal).
Use a programming language (like Python) or a hex editor to convert the string into raw bytes.
Save as .mid:
Write the binary data to a file with a .mid extension (e.g., LowFreqTrack.mid).
Open it in a DAW (e.g., Ableton, FL Studio) or MIDI player.
Tools
Python: Simplest method using bytes.fromhex().
Hex Editor: Manual option (e.g., HxD, Hex Fiend).
Online Converter: Paste hex into a tool like hex-to-file converters (less common for MIDI).
Template for Conversion
Here’s a reusable template using Python, the most straightforward approach. It includes a single-track example (like Track 1) and a multi-track structure for a full song. I’ll use the incomplete Low Freq Track 30-150 Hz snippet as a starting point and explain how to expand it.

Single-Track Template (Python)

# Save this as 'convert_to_midi.py'

# Save to .mid file
with open("LowFreqTrack.mid", "wb") as midi_file:
    midi_file.write(binary_data)

print("MIDI file saved as 'LowFreqTrack.mid'")
Steps:

Replace hex_data with your full Track 1 hex (e.g., 4D54726B00001848... up to FF2F00).
Run the script (requires Python installed).
Open LowFreqTrack.mid in a DAW.

]

# Combine header and tracks
full_hex = header + "".join(tracks)

# Convert to binary
binary_data = bytes.fromhex(full_hex)

# Save to .mid file
with open("GrittyDnB.mid", "wb") as midi_file:
    midi_file.write(binary_data)

print("Full MIDI song saved as 'GrittyDnB.mid'")
Steps:

Insert the complete hex for each track (e.g., Track 1’s 6216 bytes, Track 2’s 5928 bytes, etc.).
Run the script.
Open GrittyDnB.mid in a DAW.
Completing Track 1 Example
The Low Freq Track 30-150 Hz snippet I provided earlier was cut off mid-event. Here’s a simplified, complete version with just the Intro (32 kicks, 16 snares, 4 sub-bass) to test the template:

Full Song Considerations
Track 1 Full Hex: 6216 bytes (1848), 1342 notes, needs all events from Drumline.txt, Sub_Bass.txt, and Rolling_Bass.txt. I’d need to list all 2684 events (1342 On/Off), but the template scales to handle it.
10 Tracks: Combine all 10 tracks’ hex (e.g., 6216 + 5928 + ...), prepend the header (4D546864...).

How to Use
Get Full Hex: I can provide the complete hex for Track 1 (or any track) if you want—1342 notes is lengthy but doable.
Run Template: Paste the hex into the Python script, adjust the filename, and run.
Test: Load the .mid in a DAW, assign a drum synth (e.g., 40 Hz kick, 146 Hz snare), and tweak effects (reverb for Atmospheric 80).
