Template: Song Creation Framework
1. Input Parameters
Genre: Specify the genre (e.g., Drum and Bass, Trance House).
BPM: Tempo in beats per minute (e.g., 174 for D&B, 120 for trance).
Key: Tonal center (e.g., A minor).
Knob Settings (0–100):
Melodic: Harmonic coherence and note density.
Rhythmic: Syncopation and rhythmic complexity.
Atmospheric: Sustain and ambient texture.
Dynamic: Velocity range and expressiveness.
Energetic: Perceived pace and note speed.
Minimal: Sparsity and layer reduction.
2. Genre Characteristics Confirmation
Statement: "I’ve understood the characteristics of [genre] and translated them into the frequency ranges and note distributions below, based on our prior discussions."
Key Traits: Summarize genre-specific elements (e.g., D&B’s two-step drums, trance’s arpeggios), tied to knobs and frequencies.
3. Frequency Ranges & Instrument Mapping
Low (20–150 Hz): Kick, sub-bass (e.g., 40 Hz kick, 55 Hz A1 sub).
Low-Mid (150–400 Hz): Basslines (e.g., 110 Hz A2).
Mid (400–2000 Hz): Pads, chords (e.g., 220 Hz A3).
Mid-High (2000–6000 Hz): Leads, breaks (e.g., 523 Hz C5).
High (6000–16000 Hz): Hi-hats, cymbals (e.g., 8000 Hz hats).
4. Knob Behavior
Melodic:
0%: Unrelated scales, sparse notes.
50%: Core in key (e.g., A minor), others borrow (e.g., F major).
100%: All in key, high note density.
Rhythmic:
0%: Simple 4/4, on-beat.
50%: Moderate syncopation (e.g., 1/16 off-beats).
100%: Complex polyrhythms (e.g., triplets, 1/32).
Atmospheric:
0%: Short, dry notes.
50%: 4–8 beat sustains, light reverb.
100%: Long, ambient overlaps.
Dynamic:
0%: Flat velocity (e.g., 80).
50%: 40–100 range.
100%: 10–127, extreme contrast.
Energetic:
0%: Slow, sparse (e.g., 1/4 notes).
50%: Balanced (e.g., 1/16–1/32).
100%: Fast, dense (e.g., 1/64).
Minimal:
0%: All tracks active, no repetition.
50%: 6–8 tracks, moderate loops.
100%: 2–4 tracks, heavy repetition.
5. Output Structure (10 Tracks)
Track Name: E.g., Bassline, Arpeggio.
Frequency Range: E.g., 20–150 Hz.
MIDI Annotations: Note On/Off, pitch (e.g., C1), velocity, timing (bar:beat:tick).
Notes Played: Total note count per track.
Sections: Intro, Verse, Chorus, Breakdown, Build-Up, Drop, Outro (with bar counts).
Example Output Template
Here’s how it looks applied to a hypothetical prompt.

I’ve understood the characteristics of Drum and Bass—fast tempo (174 BPM), syncopated two-step or amen break drums, rolling bass, sparse pads, and rapid hi-hats—and translated them into the frequency ranges and note distributions below, based on our prior discussions.

BPM: 174
Key: A minor
Knob Settings:
- Melodic: 50 (core in A minor, others borrow from C major/F major)
- Rhythmic: 90 (high syncopation, triplets, ghost notes)
- Atmospheric: 20 (short, dry hits)
- Dynamic: 70 (velocity 50–120)
- Energetic: 70 (fast 1/16–1/32 notes, intense)
- Minimal: 20 (full layering, 10 tracks)
